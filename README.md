## I'm a simple guy - just few nvim config and plugins + starship + tmux
### Maintained via `GNU Stow` just like any normal person

- I try to keep my nvim config easy to read and reach for when I need to add new stuff.
- I still don't use `Mason`. It's nice and all but `lspconfig` is good enough for me.
- I really don't use tmux that much and I think it shows. 
- Played around Starship just to match my overall `rose-pine` theme stuff.
- Might add .zshrc when I feel like it.
