# Nvim personal config, finally.
1. I've started out with TJ's Kickstart.nvim
2. After sometime of extending the big-ass lua file, I got tired of it.
3. I liked how ThePrimeagen did his lua folder structure, so I adapted that
4. Also, after using Mason for a while, I felt that I don't like automagics that much
5. Note that LSPs and formatters I use are either from package manager or compiled-from-source
